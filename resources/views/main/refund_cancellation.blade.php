        period.
        To cancel a subscription, customers must log in to their account on our website and navigate to the
        "Subscriptions" section.
        Upon cancellation, the customer will continue to have access to the purchased data until the end of the
        current billing cycle. No further charges will be made after the cancellation.

        <h5>2.1 Refunds for Subscriptions:</h5>
        For subscription-based services, customers who cancel their subscription will not be eligible for a refund
        for the current billing cycle. However, they will continue to have access to the purchased data until the
        end of the billing cycle.
        In the event of technical issues or service interruptions that significantly impact the usability of the
