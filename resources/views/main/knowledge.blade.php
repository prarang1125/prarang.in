                    Information is not Knowledge. Knowledge is not Intelligence. Intelligence is not Wisdom.
                    <br>
                    Information is structured & organized data & facts, which are useful. Understanding information and
                    related concepts creates Knowledge. Application of knowledge at the right time & place, is
                    Intelligence. A broad understanding based on experience & acquired knowledge, used for the
                    betterment of self & society, is Wisdom.

                <p>" I have always imagined that paradise will be a kind of library." - Jorge Luis Borges
                    <br>
                    Can all the knowledge of the world be contained in one place if we could collect all the books ever
                    written, images ever printed & maps ever created, in one library ? Borges imagines just such a place
                    in his story " The Library of Babel, an endless library which contains not just all the books ever
                    made but even books yet to be made ( in the future). In another story Aleph, Borges stretches this
                    imagination even further where man in his quest for understanding the building blocks of language
                    itself, writes books with just one letter of the alphabet. The absurdity of it makes clear that
                    Complete knowledge of the universe is impossible for man to collect or to curate:.

                    We aim to curate a Prarang Museum showcasing the Story of the Indian Civilization through the
                    evolution of its Cities & Towns, along its Rivers. Such a river civilization museum will be built to
                    show-case India:s Culture & Nature, on the outskirts of New Delhi, along the River Ganga. While this
                    museum on the river will take a few years to build, the objects & library to be housed inside the
                    museum, have already been collected by Prarang founding team members over the past 25 years. It is
                    this unique library of books, coins, statues, maps, comics, stamps, posters, carpets, furniture,
                    textiles, fossils, stones & other collectibles relating to Indian cities, which forms the core of
                    Prarang's daily knowledge posts.
